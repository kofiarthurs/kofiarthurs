<h1>Hi, I'm Elshadin!</h1>
A bit about me: I'm currently studying computer networking and security. I went through the A+, Network+, and a bit of the Sec+ curriculum. I'm interested in an IT User Support role. I eventually want to become a penetration tester. You know, black hoodie, dark eyes, empty monster cans etc, etc.
